Prompt Design Patterns for Healthcare Decision Support

Objective
Design prompts that provide healthcare information responsibly while avoiding diagnosis, reducing hallucinations, and minimizing bias.

Design Principles

Role Clarity
The model is explicitly instructed to act as an information assistant, not a medical professional.

Explicit Boundaries
Prompts prohibit diagnosis, treatment recommendations, or definitive medical advice.

Uncertainty Handling
The model must acknowledge uncertainty when sufficient information is unavailable.

Escalation Logic
High-risk symptoms trigger guidance to seek professional medical help.

Bias Awareness
Prompts avoid assumptions based on age, gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.

Importance
Healthcare is a high stakes domain where poorly designed prompts can cause harm.
