# Prompt Engineering

This section demonstrates how prompts are designed, constrained, tested, and iterated to control LLM behavior in real-world systems.

The focus is on treating prompts as behavioral policies, not just text inputs.

# What This Section Covers
- Role-based prompt design and boundary enforcement
- Safety and guardrail prompts for high-risk scenarios
- Few-shot vs zero-shot prompt tradeoffs
- Prompt failure analysis and iteration
- Prompt integration with RAG systems

Each artifact includes rationale, constraints, and observed failure modes.
