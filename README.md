Portfolio Overview
This repository showcases enterprise-oriented work in prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and responsible Large Language Model (LLM) system design. Each project maps directly to my professional experience and demonstrates production-aware decision-making, safety considerations, and architectural rigor.


Flagship Use Case: Bias-Aware Healthcare Information Assistant

Project Overview
A bias-aware healthcare information assistant designed to deliver reliable, non-diagnostic health information using structured prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and bias-aware evaluation techniques. The system prioritizes hallucination reduction, uncertainty handling, and responsible AI behavior in a high-stakes domain.

Key Features
Prompt engineering for safe healthcare information delivery
- Role confinement and explicit boundary enforcement
- Uncertainty acknowledgement and escalation logic for high-risk symptoms

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Grounded responses using authoritative sources (CDC, WHO)
  - Context injection to reduce reliance on parametric knowledge

Vector-Based Semantic Search
  - FAISS-powered embedding search for low-latency retrieval
  - Controlled chunking strategy to balance precision and recall
